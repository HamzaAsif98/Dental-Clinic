			The mouth is an area that’s completely different from the entire body, and it takes quite a beating from the food we eat and the talking we do all day long. And this unique environment requires special care.
			Teeth cleanings remove the buildup of plaque and tartar. This buildup is for the most part natural But too much buildup leads to gum disease.
			<br>
			Gum disease is when your body’s immune system is responding to this tartar buildup with inflamed and bleeding gums. The immune system response is successful at killing off invaders like infection and flu bugs, but at a cost: like a war, there are innocent bystanders that get slaughtered. As gum disease progresses, so does the destruction to your bone and tissues in your mouth.
			<br>
			Your immune system is meant only to fight off infection for a short period of time — chronic activation of the immune system means it can get worn out and it won’t be as strong to fight off an illness. Chronic activation of the immune system can lead to diseases in the rest of your body.

			Many Products on the market claim to give you 'Pearly Whites', however there is still nothing on the market that whitens teeth as much and as quickly as the traditional gel and mouth shield. 
			<br>
			The initial cost is between €350-€400 as it includes getting a molding of your teeth done and the first whitening kit.
