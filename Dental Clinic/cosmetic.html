	<b>What is botox?</b>
<br>	
	Botox is an injection that temporarily relaxes facial muscles reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles as well as preventing new lines from forming. Common injection sites are the glabella(region between eyebrows), forehead and outer corners of eyes(crows feet).Treatment is fast and painless and lasts from 4 to 6 months.

			<b>Dermal Fillers</b>
<br>
<br>	
	Dermal Fillers: The Procedure :
			Firstly the area is evaluated to decide what areas would benefit you most.
			Injection usually takes only a few moments per site. The process of injecting, massaging, and evaluating the result is performed, and additional filler added as needed.
<br>
			Depending on the number of areas to be treated, the whole process may be as short as 15 minutes. Area is then wiped clean, if you experience a little swelling an ice pack would be recommended
<br>
